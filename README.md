# Machine-Learning-Handwritten-Character-Recognition
Program is able to recognize A-Z characters, Its implemented by modeling a neural network that is train over a dataset containing images of alphabets from A-Z.
Data set contains 372450 images of alphabets of 28Ã—2,
I used Convolutional Neural Networks CNN algorithms. Convolutional Neural Networks that are used to extract the features of the images using several layers of filters.
The dataset is very large so I have trained for only a single epoch, however, as required I can even train it for multiple epochs (which is recommended for character recognition for better accuracy).
